While developing the code, I aimed to anticipate all potential sources of errors or unexpected outcomes in the program. 
These considerations encompassed scenarios such as returning inaccurate data or attempting to retrieve information for a user that did not exist.
I also took into account the possibility of a valid GitHub user having zero repositories (Fake GITHUB ADDRESS) . However, due to the absence of readily available examples of such accounts, 
I had to exclude this case from our testing. Nevertheless, during the implementation of my program, I diligently verified the presence of content in the data retrieved. 
If the data lacked content, GitHub would provide a status code. To facilitate testing for specific situations, I incorporated error messages for conditions such as the absence of repositories or commits.
 
In general, there is room for further refinement of our test cases, but it would require access to user profiles that match the expected error scenarios to enhance our testing procedures
